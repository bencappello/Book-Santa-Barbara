    //This can be for units (E.g. headphones), time (E.g. hours or minutes), guests, etc.
    //per-two-units would be for instance for a per person per hour service or option.
    //The global options mean that it is related to the guest count, time, or both for the overall event.

    //In those cases you don't include this. In cases where the price is 'fixed' this is the fixed price.
    //In cases where the cost scales with some unit (E.g. headphones, guests, time) this will be the per unit cost.

The first nummber is the guest count, second number the price. The system will apply the given price for all guest counts less than or equal to the given guest count. Below is an example case. In that example guest counts 0 - 20 --> price $1000, guest counts 21 - 50 --> price $2000, guest counts 51 - 100 --> price $3000, guest counts over 100 --> price $4000.

So if the slider is for minutes and you want it to jump by 15 minute intervals you put 15 here. You do not put 15 in webflow. When you create the slider there you always list the 'step' attribute as 1. If you don't include this attribute here the default will always be 1.
